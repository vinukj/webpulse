Got it working on mobile (need to run video.play() in order to get it to work on Safari, autoplay alone doesn't cut it).

added frequency monitoring and got better SNR by removing alpha channel.



working on 
1. Safari 
2. Firefox
3. chrome

- No need for flash, so burning of finger
- Uses Fast fourier transform to remove few anamolies
- google geo tag can be used to capture the details of the user to large extent


TODO:
calculate FFT and the frequency bins based on the curFreq variable.
